# Chart Project

### Objective:
Develop a minimalistic application that displays a static chart based on hardcoded data.

### Description:
The application should consist of:

1) Chart Display: The chart will showcase the implementation progress of various categories (like Home Page, Navigation, etc.) for a hypothetical e-commerce website. Each category's progress should be represented as a percentage. The data for the chart will be hardcoded into the application.
2) UI/UX Design: Create a simple user-friendly interface.
3) Responsiveness: The application should provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
4) Error Handling: The application should robustly handle errors, especially potential issues with displaying the chart.
5) Testing: Write basic tests for the main functionalities of the application.

### Deliverables:
1) The source code for the application, along with instructions for building, testing, and running it.
2) A report on any challenges you encountered during the project and how you solved them.
